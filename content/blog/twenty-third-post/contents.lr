Action: API & PBI

Starting a job soon that uses Power BI (PBI) for contract analysis. I'm refamiliarizing myself with that tool. I figured I could get info made avaiable from a gov't agency, and analyze that.

I need to be able to retrieve data via API, and then plug that data into PBI.

I started at a US gov't website. Here is the URL:
