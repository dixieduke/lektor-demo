Action: Review both old material & difficulties

Project: Power BI 

Reviewed PBI documentation I had available. I'm attempting to reacquaint myself with notes I took on PBI.

I started with a document that is pretty much like an overview of the product. The PDF of that is found here:

I wanted to look at some of the problems I had documented. I found some vids that showed solutions to those. 

Here is one on date sorting (month) where it doesn't sort chronologically:

They have updated things in PBI, and it has resolved some of these problems; except for weekday name.

In reviewing my notes, probably the most important thing I read was this:

"Make sure the story being told matches the business needs; if not, the report wonâ€™t be useful."
