    <p>Action: Review both old material &amp; difficulties</p>
<p>Project: Power BI</p>
<p>Reviewed PBI documentation I had available. I'm attempting to reacquaint myself with notes I took on PBI.</p>
<p>I started with a document that is pretty much like an overview of the product. The PDF of that is found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-GB-CNTNT-eBook-DIYGuideDazzlingData.pdf">https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-GB-CNTNT-eBook-DIYGuideDazzlingData.pdf</a></p>
<p>I wanted to look at some of the problems I had documented. I found some vids that showed solutions to those.</p>
<p>Here is one on date sorting (month) where it doesn't sort chronologically:</p>

<p>They have updated things in PBI, and it has resolved some of these problems; except for weekday name.</p>
<p>In reviewing my notes, probably the most important thing I read was this:</p>
<p>"Make sure the story being told matches the business needs; if not, the report won’t be useful."</p>
