    <p>Action: Create personal budget and use PBI against that data</p>
<p>Project: Power BI</p>
<p>Wanted to play around in PBI today.</p>
<p>I created a 2019 budget with my wife, and wanted to use PBI to make that data tell a story.</p>
<p>I got to the point where I needed to calculate a value in a column, and was having an issue. I then started looking at some issues I ran into in the past to see how I could possibly resolve this particular problem.</p>
<p>I couldn't find that specific issue referenced, so I opted to simply read notes concerning dax functions, and issues with such functions.</p>
<p>Checked out sqlbi.com; looks like they have updated some things since my last visit.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will start off the day with trying to resolve my current issue. I need to move on and start reviewing old problem examples along with new PBI enhancement reviews (for all of 2018).</p>
