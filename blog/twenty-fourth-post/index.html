    <p>Action: Lottery project...</p>
<p>Project: Lottery</p>
<p>Trying to finish this project up prior to moving on to other stuff.</p>
<p>I'm going to gather this info, and use it in PBI.</p>
<p>So far, I've got the code written to get the days and numbers together in a list. These are the winning numbers for the midday pick; there is an evening pick.</p>
<p>I need to generate some output that PBI can consume; this can be a csv file. I found that Corey Shaffer had a video on the CSV module in Python. I checked that out.</p>
<p>All I really need to do is to write every two items together, and then hit return to move to the next item; rather than doing CR/LF, I could enter some symbol and then use the CSV module to look at that new symbol as a delimiter.</p>
<p>I figured out how to do this. It is pretty dirty; I need to get it all in one step, but it took me three separate scripts</p>
