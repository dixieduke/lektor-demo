<p>Drill Through:</p>
<p>Studied this feature. Used this URL to get a basic understanding of the feature:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-drillthrough">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-drillthrough</a></p>
<p>Watched Curbal's vid on this, here is that URL:</p>

<p>Here is her 2nd vid with updated drill through functionality</p>
<p>Watched Guy In A Cube's vid on this (concerning latest updates); that is here:</p>

<p>Drill Down:</p>
<p>I wanted to learn a bit about this feature. I studied the following documentation:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/sample-datasets">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/sample-datasets</a></p>
<p>Walked through the drill down samples using the provided 'retail' sample data set @ the 1st URL listed above.</p>

<p>Studied the following URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-common-query-tasks">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-common-query-tasks</a></p>
<p>I created some test tables, and pulled in some data over the web to do tasks in PBI's query editor:</p>
<p>Group By
Add Custom Column
Pivot
I then went to this tutorial that dealt with relationships:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships</a></p>
<p>I created the tables, and left off where relationships should be created. I'll pick up there later on.</p>

    <p>Action: Complete Budget in BPI</p>
<p>Project: Power BI</p>
<p>Move forward with our PBI budget.</p>
<p>I had to 'relearn' DAX so I could calculate when a date corresponded to a certain dollar amount in savings. This took a bit.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with:</p>
<p>FORMAT(
    CALCULATE(
        MIN(Savings[Month].[Date]),
        FILTER(
            Savings,
            Savings[Three Or Six Months Expenses] = "&gt;=6 Months Expenses"
        )
    ),
    "mm/yyyy"
)</p>
<p>The problem here is it returns a value as text. This is a problem because I wanted to then incorporate this into a lookup value expression; you can't use text in that when comparing dates/dollars, so I use to use the calculate expression in the new lookup measure:</p>
<p>LOOKUPVALUE(
    Savings[Current Dollars],
    Savings[Month].[Date],
    CALCULATE(
        MIN(Savings[Month].[Date]),
        FILTER(
            Savings,
            Savings[Three Or Six Months Expenses] = "&gt;=6 Months Expenses"
        )
    )
)</p>
<p>Seems a bit redundant.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I clicked around in the app to see what different things did.</p>
<p>In order to become comfortable with DAX again I spent some time reviewing SUMX, and how to subtract dates.</p>
<p>MS does a great job at publishing monthly update YT vids. I took a look at this one:</p>

    <p>Action: Review API material to better understand APIs</p>
<p>Project: API</p>
<p>Needed to review APIs. I use the request module, but I'm not sure if that is considered a restful API; I've never heard it mentioned as such.</p>
<p>I reviewed the following URL that discussed this subject:</p>
<p><a href="https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/#appendix-rest-in-a-nutshell">https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/#appendix-rest-in-a-nutshell</a></p>
<p>Here is another article, that talks about criteria that define a RESTful API:</p>
<p><a href="https://advanced-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest/what-is-rest.html">https://advanced-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest/what-is-rest.html</a></p>
<p>The following article is really a great resource that walks one through creating a RESTful API; it also lists really cool resources &amp; services that could assist one in similar endeavors:</p>

    <p>Action: Create personal budget and use PBI against that data</p>
<p>Project: Power BI</p>
<p>Wanted to play around in PBI today.</p>
<p>I created a 2019 budget with my wife, and wanted to use PBI to make that data tell a story.</p>
<p>I got to the point where I needed to calculate a value in a column, and was having an issue. I then started looking at some issues I ran into in the past to see how I could possibly resolve this particular problem.</p>
<p>I couldn't find that specific issue referenced, so I opted to simply read notes concerning dax functions, and issues with such functions.</p>
<p>Checked out sqlbi.com; looks like they have updated some things since my last visit.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will start off the day with trying to resolve my current issue. I need to move on and start reviewing old problem examples along with new PBI enhancement reviews (for all of 2018).</p>

    <p>Action: Review both old material &amp; difficulties</p>
<p>Project: Power BI</p>
<p>Reviewed PBI documentation I had available. I'm attempting to reacquaint myself with notes I took on PBI.</p>
<p>I started with a document that is pretty much like an overview of the product. The PDF of that is found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-GB-CNTNT-eBook-DIYGuideDazzlingData.pdf">https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-GB-CNTNT-eBook-DIYGuideDazzlingData.pdf</a></p>
<p>I wanted to look at some of the problems I had documented. I found some vids that showed solutions to those.</p>
<p>Here is one on date sorting (month) where it doesn't sort chronologically:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFHIqwJH19o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFHIqwJH19o</a></p>
<p>They have updated things in PBI, and it has resolved some of these problems; except for weekday name.</p>
<p>In reviewing my notes, probably the most important thing I read was this:</p>
<p>"Make sure the story being told matches the business needs; if not, the report wonâ€™t be useful."</p>

    <p>Action: Get visualizations working right in PBI.</p>
<p>Project: Power BI .gov API</p>
<p>Practice using visualizations and json data from .gov site.</p>
<p>Given I ran into problems with this yesterday, I'm starting to review all my notes concerning PBI.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is ensuring that the data values are labeled correctly (e.g., currency, date, etc.). You can do that in both power query and pbi to some extent; I'm more familiar with PBI at this point.</p>
<p>Need to look into that process in each product, and relationships between tables. For example, I pulled the year into each table I gathered from the .gov site; I may not need the year in each table; might just need it in one.</p>
<p>Here is the SC economic data harvested from the <a href="https://www.bea.gov" target="_blank">bea.gov</a> site:</p>

<p>Project: Blog site</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was having trouble doing this. The fix was to move the google font api from the .html page to the css file; doing this allowed me to sublty change the background and keep the google fonts I want.</p>
<p>I had to add two different background images--one white and one black. I had to apply images to different css elements so the entire page would have the same sublte background change.</p>
