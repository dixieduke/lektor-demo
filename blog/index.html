<p>Project: Lottery</p>
<p>Trying to finish this project up prior to moving on to other stuff.</p>
<p>I'm going to gather this info, and use it in PBI.</p>
<p>So far, I've got the code written to get the days and numbers together in a list. These are the winning numbers for the midday pick; there is an evening pick.</p>
<p>I need to generate some output that PBI can consume; this can be a csv file. I found that Corey Shaffer had a video on the CSV module in Python. I checked that out.</p>
<p>All I really need to do is to write every two items together, and then hit return to move to the next item; rather than doing CR/LF, I could enter some symbol and then use the CSV module to look at that new symbol as a delimiter.</p>
<p>I figured out how to do this. It is pretty dirty; I need to get it all in one step, but it took me three separate scripts</p>

<p>Starting a job soon that uses Power BI (PBI) for contract analysis. I'm refamiliarizing myself with that tool. I figured I could get info made avaiable from a gov't agency, and analyze that.</p>
<p>I need to be able to retrieve data via API, and then plug that data into PBI.</p>
<p>I started at a US gov't website. Here is the URL:</p>

    <p>Action: Studied options for deploying Lektor site on GitHub</p>
<p>I can deploy the blog for free in GitHub pages. Need to look into that. Here is a link that might help out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/">https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/</a></p>
<p>Here is a YT vid illustrating how to do this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj_EyZIL5A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj_EyZIL5A</a></p>
<p>I could never get this to work. Had to incorporate Travis CI in this process. Kept getting build errors. Will review later.</p>
<p>Worked on getting collapsible menus in my blog posts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp</a></p>
<p>This didn't work, so I'm working on deploying the site as is, and will work on menus later.</p>

    <p>I finished watching the Jinja2 vid. Going through the files made available during the install to try and figure out how to best format them to make the page look good.</p>
<p>Followed the steps here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/guides/blog/">https://www.getlektor.com/docs/guides/blog/</a></p>
<p>Found the following vids on YT:</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started</a></p>
<p>Outside of that, tinkered with using ordered &amp; unordered list, as well as items to make sure the format of lists looked okay.</p>

    <p>Jinja2 is a big part of Lektor. In order to make my blog site more visually appealing, I wanted to understand this tool a bit more. Awesome vid here:</p>

    <p>Lektor:</p>
<p>I was simply seeing how I could use CSS/HTML to style the page more to my liking.</p>
<p>Jinja2:</p>
<p>Need to study Jinja2 to utilize Lektor; jinja is about making templates for web pages.</p>
<p>Watching the following vid:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhXQG1qJPM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhXQG1qJPM</a></p>
<p>That vid really didn't deal with Jinja2 in the context of a web framework. I went back to Lektor's documentation for further details regarding Jinja.</p>
<p>Regarding Jinja, I needed to review that documentation for further review as I simply wasn't understanding it based on description found on Lektor's site.</p>

    <p>I wanted to study this framework so I could learn how to use it. My though is I can set it up for a simple blog. If it works out, I might use it to see if I can set up graphs and such (via Altair).</p>
