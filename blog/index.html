    <p>Action: Figure out how to add a background image to the site</p>
<p>Project: Blog site</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was having trouble doing this. The fix was to move the google font api from the .html page to the css file; doing this allowed me to sublty change the background and keep the google fonts I want.</p>
<p>I had to add two different background images--one white and one black. I had to apply images to different css elements so the entire page would have the same sublte background change.</p>

<p>I'm working with the regional income dataset. There are different parameters, and different acceptable values for those parameters. I'm stepping through all of those (GeoFips, LineCode, etc.) to figure out how to get at meaningful data.</p>

<p>Project: Blog site</p>
<p>Wanted to look into providing a background on website. Studying that.</p>
<p>I added an image, and pointed the css file to that image; however, that messed up my google fonts. I couldn't find similar problems on the web. I'll have to come back to this.</p>

    <p>Action: Parsing json made available via .gov's api</p>
<p>Project: .gov API</p>
<p>Getting data from the .gov site. Need to know more about how to consume .json data using Python.</p>
<p>Watched Corey Shafer's vid on this; here is that URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N6a-VLBa2I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N6a-VLBa2I</a></p>
<p>I needed to figure out how to use json data with PBI. I viewed Curbal's vid on this...here is that URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX2idV79P24">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX2idV79P24</a></p>
<p>Right now, I can't see a way around having to 'clean' the data prior to pushing it into PBI.</p>
<p>With the tables available via api on the .gov site, there are parameter lists, and parameter values for tables. There are acceptable values for each of the parameters. I need to get the param lists, and use names from that list to look up acceptable values. These are two separate api calls; the second of which is the call for the values. The second api call has the parameter name as part of the URL, so I need to make a call for each name and store the first and second calls in different objects, and write to separate files.</p>

    <p>Action: Build out API to get data from .gov site</p>
<p>Project: .gov API</p>
<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis makes data available via API. I want to retrieve that data and use PBI to generate some reports against harvested data.</p>
<p>Here is the URL for the API:</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm">https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm</a></p>
<p>The API is accessed using the following URL (I believe):</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.bea.gov/api/data">https://apps.bea.gov/api/data</a>.</p>
<p>Was able to build out a successful request, and got back the following info:</p>
<p>b'{"BEAAPI":{"Request":{"RequestParam":[{"ParameterName":"USERID","ParameterValue":"F414B54D-68CF-452A-BFD9-7B7BDA23AE7C"},{"ParameterName":"METHOD","ParameterValue":"GETDATASETLIST"}]},"Results":{"Dataset":[{"DatasetName":"RegionalData","DatasetDescription":"The RegionalData dataset is obsolete. Please use the Regional dataset. See API documentation at apps.bea.gov/developers"},{"DatasetName":"NIPA","DatasetDescription":"Standard NIPA tables"},{"DatasetName":"NIUnderlyingDetail","DatasetDescription":"Standard NI underlying detail tables"},{"DatasetName":"MNE","DatasetDescription":"Multinational Enterprises"},{"DatasetName":"FixedAssets","DatasetDescription":"Standard Fixed Assets tables"},{"DatasetName":"ITA","DatasetDescription":"International Transactions Accounts"},{"DatasetName":"IIP","DatasetDescription":"International Investment Position"},{"DatasetName":"GDPbyIndustry","DatasetDescription":"GDP by Industry"},{"DatasetName":"RegionalIncome","DatasetDescription":"Regional Income data sets"},{"DatasetName":"RegionalProduct","DatasetDescription":"Regional Product data sets"},{"DatasetName":"InputOutput","DatasetDescription":"Input-Output Data"},{"DatasetName":"UnderlyingGDPbyIndustry","DatasetDescription":"Underlying GDP by Industry"},{"DatasetName":"IntlServTrade","DatasetDescription":"International Services Trade"},{"DatasetName":"Regional","DatasetDescription":"Regional data sets"},{"DatasetName":"APIDatasetMetaData","DatasetDescription":"Metadata about other API datasets"}]}}} '</p>
<p>Need to figure out how to parse/consume that successfully so I can pass that in some format that PBI will recognize.</p>
<p>Created virtualenv for this project and installed requests. Created github repo.</p>
<p>Need to figure out how to differentiate between the different datasets made available on that site.</p>

    <p>Action: See what it takes to get PBI report into a blog</p>
<p>Project: Lottery</p>
<p>I checked out documentation related to getting PBI reports into blog posts. Here is the site I found that info at:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-publish-to-web">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-publish-to-web</a></p>
<p>Following those steps, I published the info in the blog. Here is the latest report regarding the lottery data:</p>
<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDA4NmQwMWItMGNiNi00MGU5LWI4YWYtOGQ2NTk3NDI0MTUzIiwidCI6Ijg2NjY1ZWQzLWU1NjQtNDFhNy1iMDUyLWM4MWYxMDVlNTZkNCJ9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe><p>The data in the blog post stays synced with the report; if you make changes to the report, those changes will be reflected in the blog post.</p>

    <p>Action: Frequency Distribution Analysis PBI</p>
<p>Project: Lottery</p>
<p>Need to determine frequency at which certain numbers show up in the Pick3 lottery. This is to be done in PBI, and published to the site. I imagine this will be some histogram or something like that.</p>
<p>Need a way to validate my findings are correct.</p>
<p>Reviewing how to do stats in PBI. Of course, Curbal's YT channel has a lot of content covering this. Here is one I checked out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFWHDWiqXzI&amp;list=PLDz00l_jz6zxc8iinR39euGqFm4SDabBf&amp;index=4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFWHDWiqXzI&amp;list=PLDz00l_jz6zxc8iinR39euGqFm4SDabBf&amp;index=4</a></p>
<p>My dates are okay, but PBI is changing the year in one of my dates, which causes Sundays to appear in the reports; the lottery doesn't issue #s on Sundays. Trying to figure out how to change the data prior to importing into PBI as that seems like the easiest thing to do.</p>
