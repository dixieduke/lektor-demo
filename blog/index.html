    <p>Action: See what it takes to get PBI report into a blog</p>
<p>Project: Lottery</p>
<p>I checked out documentation related to getting PBI reports into blog posts. Here is the site I found that info at:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-publish-to-web">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-publish-to-web</a></p>
<p>Following those steps, I published the info in the blog. Here is the latest report regarding the lottery data:</p>
<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDA4NmQwMWItMGNiNi00MGU5LWI4YWYtOGQ2NTk3NDI0MTUzIiwidCI6Ijg2NjY1ZWQzLWU1NjQtNDFhNy1iMDUyLWM4MWYxMDVlNTZkNCJ9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe><p>The data in the blog post stays synced with the report; if you make changes to the report, those changes will be reflected in the blog post.</p>

<p>Set frequency &amp; relative frequency up as reported values. Made sure relative frequency was set to ALLSELECTED as total % changed based on slicer selection.</p>
<p>Published report to PBI site.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I would like to see if I can get the report into a blog or something.</p>

    <p>Action: Frequency Distribution Analysis PBI</p>
<p>Project: Lottery</p>
<p>Need to determine frequency at which certain numbers show up in the Pick3 lottery. This is to be done in PBI, and published to the site. I imagine this will be some histogram or something like that.</p>
<p>Need a way to validate my findings are correct.</p>
<p>Reviewing how to do stats in PBI. Of course, Curbal's YT channel has a lot of content covering this. Here is one I checked out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFWHDWiqXzI&amp;list=PLDz00l_jz6zxc8iinR39euGqFm4SDabBf&amp;index=4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFWHDWiqXzI&amp;list=PLDz00l_jz6zxc8iinR39euGqFm4SDabBf&amp;index=4</a></p>
<p>My dates are okay, but PBI is changing the year in one of my dates, which causes Sundays to appear in the reports; the lottery doesn't issue #s on Sundays. Trying to figure out how to change the data prior to importing into PBI as that seems like the easiest thing to do.</p>

<p>Project: Lottery</p>
<p>Trying to finish this project up prior to moving on to other stuff.</p>
<p>I'm going to gather this info, and use it in PBI.</p>
<p>So far, I've got the code written to get the days and numbers together in a list. These are the winning numbers for the midday pick; there is an evening pick.</p>
<p>I need to generate some output that PBI can consume; this can be a csv file. I found that Corey Shaffer had a video on the CSV module in Python. I checked that out.</p>
<p>All I really need to do is to write every two items together, and then hit return to move to the next item; rather than doing CR/LF, I could enter some symbol and then use the CSV module to look at that new symbol as a delimiter.</p>
<p>I figured out how to do this. It is pretty dirty; I need to get it all in one step, but it took me three separate scripts</p>

<p>Starting a job soon that uses Power BI (PBI) for contract analysis. I'm refamiliarizing myself with that tool. I figured I could get info made avaiable from a gov't agency, and analyze that.</p>
<p>I need to be able to retrieve data via API, and then plug that data into PBI.</p>
<p>I started at a US gov't website. Here is the URL:</p>

<p>I can deploy the blog for free in GitHub pages. Need to look into that. Here is a link that might help out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/">https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/</a></p>
<p>Here is a YT vid illustrating how to do this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj_EyZIL5A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj_EyZIL5A</a></p>
<p>I could never get this to work. Had to incorporate Travis CI in this process. Kept getting build errors. Will review later.</p>
<p>Worked on getting collapsible menus in my blog posts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp</a></p>
<p>This didn't work, so I'm working on deploying the site as is, and will work on menus later.</p>

    <p>I finished watching the Jinja2 vid. Going through the files made available during the install to try and figure out how to best format them to make the page look good.</p>
<p>Followed the steps here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/guides/blog/">https://www.getlektor.com/docs/guides/blog/</a></p>
<p>Found the following vids on YT:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS-1vD81Pdc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS-1vD81Pdc</a></p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started</a></p>
<p>Outside of that, tinkered with using ordered &amp; unordered list, as well as items to make sure the format of lists looked okay.</p>
