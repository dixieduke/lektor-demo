    <p>Lektor:</p>
<p>I was simply seeing how I could use CSS/HTML to style the page more to my liking.</p>
<p>Jinja2:</p>
<p>Need to study Jinja2 to utilize Lektor; jinja is about making templates for web pages.</p>
<p>Watching the following vid:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhXQG1qJPM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhXQG1qJPM</a></p>
<p>That vid really didn't deal with Jinja2 in the context of a web framework. I went back to Lektor's documentation for further details regarding Jinja.</p>
<p>Regarding Jinja, I needed to review that documentation for further review as I simply wasn't understanding it based on description found on Lektor's site.</p>

    <p>Action: Studied virtualenv &amp; altair</p>
<p>Need to learn how to create virtualenv on windows machine.</p>
<p>Referenced this site for installing &amp; activating virtualenv on windows:</p>
<p><a href="https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/">https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/</a></p>
<p>Once you are in env\Scripts, you can run .\activate (via Powershell) and you will have the following indication that you are in your virtual environment:</p>
<p>PS C:\py\lottery\env\Scripts&gt; .\activate
(env) PS C:\py\lottery\env\Scripts&gt;</p>
<p>Reviewed different options. Looked at some recent posts on reddit concerning bokeh and alternative packages. Altair seems to be relatively new, and its creators are known to produce fantastic tools.</p>
