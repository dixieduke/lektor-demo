    <p>Action: Studied options for deploying Lektor site on GitHub</p>
<p>I can deploy the blog for free in GitHub pages. Need to look into that. Here is a link that might help out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/">https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/</a></p>
<p>Here is a YT vid illustrating how to do this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj_EyZIL5A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pj_EyZIL5A</a></p>
<p>I could never get this to work. Had to incorporate Travis CI in this process. Kept getting build errors. Will review later.</p>
<p>Worked on getting collapsible menus in my blog posts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp</a></p>
<p>This didn't work, so I'm working on deploying the site as is, and will work on menus later.</p>

    <p>I finished watching the Jinja2 vid. Going through the files made available during the install to try and figure out how to best format them to make the page look good.</p>
<p>Followed the steps here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/guides/blog/">https://www.getlektor.com/docs/guides/blog/</a></p>
<p>Found the following vids on YT:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS-1vD81Pdc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS-1vD81Pdc</a></p>
<p>Used the following link to see about adding google fonts to stylesheet via api:</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started</a></p>
<p>Outside of that, tinkered with using ordered &amp; unordered list, as well as items to make sure the format of lists looked okay.</p>

    <p>Jinja2 is a big part of Lektor. In order to make my blog site more visually appealing, I wanted to understand this tool a bit more. Awesome vid here:</p>

    <p>Lektor:</p>
<p>I was simply seeing how I could use CSS/HTML to style the page more to my liking.</p>
<p>Jinja2:</p>
<p>Need to study Jinja2 to utilize Lektor; jinja is about making templates for web pages.</p>
<p>Watching the following vid:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhXQG1qJPM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhXQG1qJPM</a></p>
<p>That vid really didn't deal with Jinja2 in the context of a web framework. I went back to Lektor's documentation for further details regarding Jinja.</p>
<p>Regarding Jinja, I needed to review that documentation for further review as I simply wasn't understanding it based on description found on Lektor's site.</p>

    <p>Action: Studied virtualenv &amp; altair</p>
<p>Need to learn how to create virtualenv on windows machine.</p>
<p>Referenced this site for installing &amp; activating virtualenv on windows:</p>
<p><a href="https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/">https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/</a></p>
<p>Once you are in env\Scripts, you can run .\activate (via Powershell) and you will have the following indication that you are in your virtual environment:</p>
<p>(env) PS C:\py\lottery\env\Scripts&gt;</p>
<p>Reviewed different options. Looked at some recent posts on reddit concerning bokeh and alternative packages. Altair seems to be relatively new, and its creators are known to produce fantastic tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/overview.html">https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/overview.html</a></p>
<p>The creators recommend using JupyterLab as the front-end. Here is the URL for that front-end:</p>
