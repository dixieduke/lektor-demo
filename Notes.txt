Models & templates directory are related in that there is an *.ini file for each .html page in the templates folder (with the exception of the layout.html file).

- .ini files in the models folder have sections with titled enclosed by brackets
- each section has attributes that have assigned values, kind of like a dictionary
- The .ini files are models. 
- models are used to affect the behavior of the data & the admin interface
- adding something to the .ini files means you are adding a field to the page
